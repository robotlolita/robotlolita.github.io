title: What Is Programming?
---

Have you ever asked yourself "What is programming, really?"

It's one of those questions that, as software engineers---or even
as programming languages people---we tend to take for granted more
often than we tend to explore its nuances and implications.
Sure, if we were to take a descriptive approach to answer this
question, "programming" would be the act of instructing computers
through programs---a set of rules to guide computers toward
a certain goal. Often done through "programming languages," such
as Java or HTML.

Funny enough, this definition---this understanding of programming---is 
largely unchanged since Grace Hopper, John Backus, and others published
the glossary of computing terms in the ACM journal, in 1954. But their
definition is slightly more comprehensive:

> [Programming is] to plan a computation or process from the asking of a
> question to the delivery of the results, including the integration of
> the operation into an existing system. Thus programming consists of
> planning and coding, including numerical analysis, systems analysis,
> specification of printing formats, and any other functions necessary
> to the integration of a computer in a system.

The inclusion of analysis in the definition matches many of the aspects
of programming job that don't involve *writing* anything, but rather
understanding systems---we've moved to giving these tasks its own
names instead: debugging, monitoring, etc.

Now, taking a descriptive approach to explore what "programming" means
is very useful if what we're interested into is figuring out what
people talk about when they talk about "programming". What are they
doing today? How do they approach this activity? What do the tools
and processes for this look like?

But the descriptive approach is not always the right one. Indeed, if
you're trying to explore the question "what programming should look like?",
then investigating what "programming" means today is not sufficient. You
have to question it. Why does programming need programming languages?
Why are programming languages often presented in textual formats?
Why are "rules" involved? Why is "analysis" not part of the general
understanding of the term anymore?

These are things I've been thinking for a long time---and they're things
that guide how I approach the design of Crochet---, but I never took the
time to put all of these ideas down properly. So I'm hoping this article
will help shed some light on how I view "programming", and how I hope
the understanding of the concept can change.

## Programming, Today

Let's start by investigating where we're currently standing. But rather
than look at what people *say* they mean by "programming", let's look
at what they *do* when they say they're "programming".

Meet Alissa Grant, a fashion design graduate who pivoted to tech. She
works as a junior web developer in a small company that builds code-querying
tools. And today she's continuing to improve how the tool displays inferred
types to users. There are places that should have it always visible, and
places that should have the information available on interaction. She's
working on the former part of the task.
