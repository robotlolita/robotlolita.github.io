title:  On semicolons, pseudo-technical and subjective arguments, revisited
snip:   Yo dawg, I herd you like bikeshedding...
---


<p>
The JavaScript community is, indeed, very mature — just like any other
programming community. We always find time to properly and politely (and
heatedly!) discuss the most important kinds of topics: like whether to
use <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/3057">semicolons or not</a>, or whether to use <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs">tabs or spaces</a>. Or yet, whether
to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">Emacs or Vi{,m}</a>. Of course, everyone knows you should use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>,
so I don't even know why those discussions surface.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I decided to write a post to shed some light on the subject
<del>and let the flames begin</del>. I tried to just shake this whole discussion
away, because it started out too subjective&hellip; but I can't. This is an
important post. <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">Someone is <b>wrong</b> on the internet!</a>

<p>
Discussions on the rules of <i>Automatic Semicolon Insertion</i> (henceforth <i>ASI</i>)
aren't a new thing in the community. In fact, we've been seeing these for as
long as the community exists — well, perhaps not as much, but definitely the
discussions did grow as the community as a whole grew.
</p>
<p>
On the one side, there are people who argue that <i>ASI</i> is harmful, and you
should be ashamed of using such a excuse for "poor coding style". Of course,
the qualities of a coding style are, usually, extremely subjective, and make
absolute no sense taken without context — that is, without stating what
concerns the particular coding style chosen tries to address. Other arguments
involve blatant (and sometimes personal) attacks on people who don't use
semicolons in their code, misconceptions about when <i>ASI</i> applies, and things
like "we've told ASI is harmful, so it must be!" or "JS is not a semicolon-less
language" — I wonder if they would also consider Python and Haskell as
non-semicolon-less languages, since they also have semicolons and ASI (albeit
much more significant line breaks and white space handling).
</p>
<p>
On the other side, there are people who argue that semicolons are harmful, and
we're much better off without them. Arguments against semicolons vary from a
simple "Yes, yes we can!", passing through the "But I use other languages that
don't require semicolons!", to the "Omitting semicolons make errors more
apparent by transforming them in non-usual things" — needless to say those are
not the actual quotes, but they are close enough to the crux of the arguments.
</p>
<p>
In this post, despite the hints for flamewar here and there, I'll try to lay
out the discussion from a not-so-biased standpoint. I am on the <i>Yay ASI!</i>,
side, though, so you might see some bias here and there — I'll try to make
those as overt as possible, so you can just laugh it off (or rage) and move
on.

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">What is <i>ASI</i>?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
We can't start this whole discussion without first clarifying what we're
talking about. That's why, we first need to define what in the Lord's name
<i>ASI</i> is.
</p>
<p>
Let's start with the <a href="http://es5.github.com/#x7.9">specification</a> definition of this whole mess:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Certain ECMAScript statements (empty statement, variable statement,
expression statement, <code>do-while</code> statement, <code>continue</code> statement, <code>break</code>
statement, <code>return</code> statement, and <code>throw</code> statement) must be terminated with
semicolons. Such semicolons may always appear explicitly in the source
text. For convenience, however, such semicolons may be omitted from the
source text in certain situations. These situations are described by saying
that semicolons are automatically inserted into the source code token stream
in those situations.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
The specification then goes on to define all of the rules by which semicolon
insertion takes place.
</p>
<p>
If you still don't grasp what <i>ASI</i> is after reading this part of the
specification, don't worry, most people don't. We could summarise it as: "You
need semicolons to end the statements cited above, but for convenience you can
omit them in some situations, if you want to."
</p>
<p>
As <a href="http://brendaneich.com/2012/04/the-infernal-semicolon/">Brendan Eich</a> noted in his post, <i>ASI</i> is an syntactic error-correction
procedure, that got implemented in JavaScript engine parsers and then made it
into the specification. This means that, technically speaking, all code written
without semicolons has syntactic errors in them. There's no denying it, because
that's how the specification describes these procedures.
</p>
<p>
Practically speaking, though, the parsing rules and <i>ASI</i> rules — should we
even call it that, since parsers don't need to actually add that token, — for
the ECMAScript language are pretty deterministic, and ambiguities in terms of
<i>Automatic Semicolon Insertion</i> can be resolved in a single or double look-ahead
— if we ignore comments and horizontal white space.
</p>
<p>
In fact, if we looked at the practical matter of the subject, we could
categorise famous languages' semicolon insertion rules in the following groups:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>White-space strict (aka Statements ends as early as possible)</dt><dd>
<p>
    With <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> as the most known example of this particular style. In a
    language where "statements ends as early as possible", you can kind of
    define the language's statements' (or expressions) rules as the following:
</p>



<pre class="src src-bnf">&lt;statement&gt;        ::= ( lots of junk ) &lt;end-of-statement&gt;
&lt;end-of-statement&gt; ::= NEWLINE | <span style="color: #A6E32D;">";"</span>
</pre>


<p>
    Which, at a first glance, might look quite easy to remember, right?
    Unfortunately, in real world code, there are quite some more intricacies
    regarding these rules. Sticking with Python, since you want a little more
    expressiveness on how to lay out your long statements, Python offers you
    optional implicit and explicit statement continuations. So, a simple
    example with a string spanning multiple lines (and yes, I am aware of the
    additional constructs for multi-line strings in the language), would look
    like the following:
</p>



<pre class="src src-bnf">foo = <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"a string"</span>    \
    + <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"in multiple"</span> \
    + <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"lines."</span>
</pre>


<p>
    Notice how each line has to be terminated with an explicit
    continuation. Worse! If your editor can't highlight invisible characters,
    you risk running into the following error:
</p>



<pre class="src src-shell-script">$ python test.py
  File <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"test.py"</span>, line 1
     foo = <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"a line"</span> <span style="color: #A6E32D;">\</span>
                      ^
SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation character.
</pre>


<p>    
    An alternative to explicit continuations are implicit line joins, which
    happen on parenthesised expressions:
</p>



<pre class="src src-bnf">foo = ( <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"a string"</span>
        <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"in multiple"</span>
        <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"lines."</span> )
</pre>


<p>    
    Note that, in Python's particular case, the concatenation operator isn't
    necessary when two chunks of strings are separated by just
    white-space. This style saves you from worrying about whether there's
    white-space after your explicit continuations, but then your simple
    <code>&lt;end-of-statement&gt;</code> rules stop being just <code>NEWLINE | “;”</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>



<dl>
<dt>Non-white-space strict (aka If we can't parse, insert a damn semicolon!)</dt><dd>
<p>
    ECMAScript is actually the only language I know who fits this bill —
    Haskell having even more complex statement rules, but managing to be
    overtly white-space strict.
</p>
<p>
    In ECMAScript, your statements <b>always</b> ends up with a semicolon. Whether
    you need to explicitly spell one in your source code, though, is another
    matter entirely. In fact, you can write large JavaScript applications
    without needing to write any semicolon in your source code at all,
    (comments excluded), as long as you stay away from old-style <code>for</code> loops.
</p>
<p>
    In JavaScript, the same example above would look like this:
</p>



<pre class="src src-bnf">var foo = <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"a string"</span>
        + <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"in multiple"</span>
        + <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"lines."</span>
</pre>


<p>
    ECMAScript's handling of statement continuation, imho, feels much more
    natural to read and write than Python's one. Therefore, they are, of
    course, <b>TEH BESTEST</b> — if my feelings would constitute actual arguments,
    sadly they do not.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">How <i>ASI</i> actually works?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
If you've been reading the comments from this whole <del>flamewar</del> discussion,
you'll see that many people describe <i>ASI</i> in JavaScript as a <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/3057#issuecomment-5138012"><b>guessing game</b></a>. They couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, there's no guessing at
all, everything is extremely deterministic from the grammar of the language
itself.
</p>
<p>
And what's more, to check if an statement ends, a parser would need to use at
most 2 look-aheads, if we don't consider comments and white-space. So, let's
first define what the usual rule for ending a statement in JavaScript is:
</p>



<pre class="src src-bnf">&lt;end-of-statement&gt; ::= <span style="color: #A6E32D;">";"</span>
                     | &lt;horizontal-space&gt;* NEWLINE blank*
                       (and STATEMENT_ENDED? (not &lt;continuation&gt;))
&lt;horizontal-space&gt; ::= SPACE | TAB | &lt;comment&gt;
&lt;continuation&gt;     ::= <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"("</span> | <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"["</span> | &lt;infix-operator&gt;
</pre>


<p>
Well, actually, it's not as simple as that. You have a few special cases in the
language to handle prefix operators and a few others, like the <code>return</code>
statement, which the specification calls <code>restricted productions</code>.
</p>
<p>
For prefix statements, it just suffices to say that they <b>require</b> an argument
succeeding then, and so can't end earlier due to a line break. Thus, the
following is valid JavaScript:
</p>



<pre class="src src-js"><span style="color: #C48DFF;">var</span> <span style="color: #729FCF;">a</span> = 1
~
a
<span style="color: #75766A;">// </span><span style="color: #75766A;">=&gt; -2</span>
</pre>


<p>
In the case of <code>restricted productions</code>, however, we have the "awesome" <code>&lt;no line-break here&gt;</code> restriction in the grammar itself. Which means that, while
these productions <b>may</b> have something succeeding the token, they <b>do not</b>
require that such a case happens, and as such, a line break would indicate that
we want to end the statement early. A good example of <code>restricted productions</code>,
and that is widely (and mistakenly<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>) used to indicate how you should
always end your statements with a semicolon, is the <code>return</code> statement, which
accepts an <b>optional</b> return value:
</p>



<pre class="src src-bnf">&lt;return-stmt&gt; ::= <span style="color: #A6E32D;">"return"</span> [no line break here] &lt;expression&gt;
</pre>



<pre class="src src-js">(<span style="color: #C48DFF;">function</span>(){ <span style="color: #C48DFF;">return</span> 1 })()
<span style="color: #75766A;">// </span><span style="color: #75766A;">=&gt; 1</span>

;(<span style="color: #C48DFF;">function</span>(){ <span style="color: #C48DFF;">return</span>
              2 }()
<span style="color: #75766A;">// </span><span style="color: #75766A;">=&gt; undefined</span>
</pre>


<p>
Of course, inserting a semicolon after <code>2</code> in the second example won't prevent
the <code>return</code> statement from always returning <code>undefined</code>.

<h2 id="sec-4">Is <i>ASI</i> safe?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
We've seen that all of the <i>ASI</i> rules are pretty deterministic, and they don't
rely on any kind of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a> from hell that only parsers and parser-writers
know. They are also pretty manageable for a human brain to keep on his head
while reading the code — or at least, I consider JavaScript's ASI rules,
despite all of the complexity, in the same level of cognitive overhead as
Python's, if only because it <b>feels</b> more natural to me.
</p>
<p>
But do all of the engines implement it properly? Is it safe? Will my code
suddenly break?!  Well, if you've been <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/3057#issuecomment-5135562">blindly following the Cult of Crockford</a>,
you might have been lead to believe that the answer to all of those questions
would be: <b>no</b>, <b>NO!</b>, <b>BET THE HELL IT WILL</b>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you should apply the <code>not</code> predicate from higher-order logic to all
of those answers to get the actual, useful, answers. So, addressing the
concerns in order:

<p> 
Well, as <b>inimino</b> says in his post about <a href="http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons">JavaScript semicolons</a>, there's no
reason to fear any incompatible behaviour between browsers in regards to the
"feature" (or misfeature, the definitions vary in the community). I have not
been able to verify this claim with empiric proofs yet to date, but from my
experiments in code, it seems to hold perfectly valid.
</p>
<p>
If any browser implementer would like to clarify the matter, it would be an
interesting (and welcome) addition, indeed.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Another misconception is that bugs in browser JavaScript engines mean that
using semicolons everywhere is safer, and will protect the developer from
compatibility issues between browsers. This is simply not the case. All
extant browsers implement the specification correctly with regard to ASI, and
any bugs that may have existed are long since lost in the mists of early Web
history. There is no reason to be concerned about browser compatibility in
regard to semicolon insertion: all browsers implement the same rules and they
are the rules given by the spec and explained above.

No. I mean yes. I mean, it depends on what you mean by safe. From a technical

As <a href="http://twitter.com/littlecalculist">David Herman</a>, a TC39 member, kindly enough clarified <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/littlecalculist/status/191549755413889024">TC39 won't just break working code for no good reason</a>. All the more when there's such a large body of
working code relying on this particular feature all the way around.
</p>
<p>
Brendan Eich also discussed the issue with compatibility with older versions of
ECMAScript and legacy code as they move forward to extend the language, several
times (in his blog, in es-discuss, in twitter, in&hellip;).
</p>
<p>
It can all be summed up as: "if something is working and in use in the
JavaScript community, we can't just break it."
</p>
<p>
So, no, your code will not suddenly break if you start omitting semicolons here
and there. Now, I can't guarantee people won't want to break <b>you</b>.

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Reasons to use or not ASI</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
So, this all said, there are any actual arguments in favour of omitting
semicolons from your code, aside from the "well, duh, we can!" non-argument
argument? Turns out, there are a few, but they're all overtly subjective, and
not in any sense technical:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency! I write code in other languages that use no semicolons, so
   avoiding them in JavaScript makes it easier for me to switch back and forth,
   without inserting them in the wrong places, in the wrong languages.

</li>
<li>Semicolons are not necessary, thus removing them promotes them from ordinary
   statement terminators/separators to special tokens that should be present in
   certain situations. It's expected that this change in the role of semicolons
   would highlight certain kinds of bugs, by making lacks of semicolons in
   places where they matter more apparent.

</li>
<li>Removing semicolons reduces the overall noise of a source code, granted the
   indication given by semicolons is duplicated by line breaks and indentation,
   this means that we don't have extraneous and needless symbols to distract
   you from the actual code.
</li>
</ul>



<p>
Of course, there are reasons for not relying on ASI, and the valid ones are
also overtly subjective, and not in any sense technical:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency! I write code in other languages that use no ASI, so putting
   them everywhere in JavaScript makes it easier for me to switch back and
   forth, without omitting them in the wrong places, in the wrong languages.

</li>
<li>Avoiding semicolons means that you have a higher cognitive load, and you
   must always scan much more of the source code than you should, just to be
   sure that the next line doesn't imply a continuation.

</li>
<li>I use tools that don't support ASI (like JSMin, or JSLint).
</li>
</ul>



<p>   
Okay, the last one of those is not a subjective reason not to rely on ASI, but
is not a technical reason on why <b>other</b> people should do the same. After all,
you're just relying on a broken tool.
