      snip: |
        A programming *system* to make creating digital, interactive content
        **accessible to non-programmers** (through a particular view of live
        feedback), **safe** (through capability security), and **collaborative**
        (through a new semantics for modular extension). It aims to foster a
        remixing culture.

        Can programming be seen as literary art?

        Belle is a small experiment where programs are arbitrary pieces of text
        only given meaning through rewrite rules (functions that take the
        program and yield a new program), allowing function to follow form
        in a more literal sense.<br>
