## 1. Introduction

While the concept of object-orientation is pretty simple, the amount of concepts
that exist in the field, and how they appear in programming languages tends to
be fairly overwhelming. A solid understanding of the basics can help you
navigate through these concepts and not only understand when or how each one is
used, but the subtle differences between each of these languages that might make
your debugging life more difficult.

This blog post will cover concepts of modelling and constructing objects (both
class-based approaches and prototype-based approaches), selecting which
operation to run (forms of dispatch, method vs. message-based languages, etc.),
inheritance (single vs. multiple, concatenative vs. delegative, etc.), and a few
other relevant concepts.

Make yourself comfortable, this is going to be a pretty long post~ (but there'll
be cute drawings along the way to ease the pain :3).

## 2. A Re-Introduction to Object-Orientation

Before we start, we need to know what we're going to be talking about. The
question of "What even is object-orientation?" is a tricky one, because a lot of
people mean different things by that. Before we can talk about
object-orientation, we have to discuss what objects are though.


> Objects are values that determine which operations they support.

### 2.1. Dynamic Behaviour

In a sense,
[objects are values that determine which operations they support][cook-oo] [^1]. That
is, if I have the number `1`, in order for that number to be considered an
object the ways in which I can operate on it have to be determined by the number
itself.

![A hand with its thumb tapping the screen of a smartphone](/files/2016/12/oo-01.png)
{: .pull-left }

For example, consider a person tapping the active screen of a smartphone. What
happens when they do that? Well, it depends on *what* they're tapping, right?
Tapping the icon of an application in the home screen might bring
that application's window up, so the user can use it. On the other hand, tapping
one of the characters in the virtual keyboard while having a text field focused
would add that character to the text field.

Note that while the way one interacts with these many things in a smartphone is
the same: they press some area of the screen; the outcome of all of these
actions depends on what one is interacting with. I, as an user, can't really
make it so that when I tap the *send* button in the Mail application it deletes
the current email — it's the Mail application itself that defines what happens
when you tap its buttons. But nothing prevents another application from having a
button with the same name, located in the same place, to do a completely
different thing.
{: .clear }

![The number '1', in a box. Attached to the box four round buttons labelled '+', '-', '*', and '/'](/files/2016/12/oo-02.png)
{: .pull-right }

Objects behave similarly. If my numbers are objects, then the only thing I can do
is “press buttons on them” and wait for the outcome of that. A number might have
buttons labelled `+`, `-`, `×`, etc. and each number determines what
happens when you press such a button. Not all object-oriented languages allow
you to literally press buttons on the screen to interact with objects, but the
idea of “calling a method on an object” or “sending a message to an object”
fulfills a similar purpose.
{: .clear }


### 2.2. First-class Values

Another important part of the concept of an object is that they are a
*first-class entity*. That is, there isn't a single, fixed way that you must use
in order to refer to that object. You can alias it (for example, by putting it
in a variable), you can pass it to a function as an argument, you can return it
as results from functions, and possibly more.

To see why this property is important, let's go back to the numbers example. If
numbers were not first-class in a programming language, then `1` and `2` would
be valid uses of it, `1 + 2` would also be a valid use of it, but `1 + two`
wouldn't. That's because the word `two` is not the same as the word `2`, and
entities that are not first-class have to show up with the exact name that was
assigned to them by the language, and no other name. With this restriction it
would be pretty difficult to make programs do anything.


### 2.2. Objects and Object-Orientation

So now that we've seen what objects are, what does it mean to be
"object-oriented"? We can say that an object-oriented *program* is one where its
computations are done through sending messages to (or calling methods
on/pressing buttons on) objects. Given that, an object-oriented language is any
language that supports writing programs in such way.

Not that in order to not exclude some of the languages we'll talk about, and you
might know, we don't require a language to have good support or encourage
programs to be written in this manner, just that there is the possibility of
doing so. Java, for example, does not have a good support for writing programs
in this way (numbers aren't objects, `+` is not a button in a number that you
can press, among other things), so programs written in that language tend to
have some computations that are expressed as method calls, and some that use
concepts from procedural programming. In this article we're more concerned about
the concepts themselves and how they appear in different languages, than with a
philosophy of how programs should be written, so it would not make much sense to
exclude these languages just because it's harder to write object-orientd
programs in them.


## 3. Constructing objects

We know what objects are, but how are objects *made*? Well, once again there are
many answers to that question — you'll get used to this phrase in no time!
\*Ahem\*, where were we…? Oh, right, making objects! Because there are too many
ways in which this happen we'll just cover the two major models: class-based
objects, and prototype-based objects. Most object-oriented languages go for one
or the other, and even though there are many differences between languages that
use the same model, we can talk about those differences as separate concepts
later.


### 3.1. The Class-based School

Possibly the most widely used model for objects is the *class-based* object
model. In this model one first defines how objects of a particular kind look
like (these definitions are called “class”), then they may use that definition
to construct actual objects of that kind.

To put it in more concrete terms, imagine I write a song, but in music notation.
It doesn't matter how much I wave the sheet music around, that piece of paper
just *describes* how to play the song, it's not the song itself — you can't
listen to it by looking at it, although you might be able to imagine how it will
sound if you can read music notation. Given that sheet music, however, someone
can play that song, record it, and then other people can enjoy the song to their
heart's contents.

![On the left, a sheet music, labelled 'class'. On the right, a young woman plays the music notated in the sheet in a piano. The sounds coming out of it are labelled 'object', the woman is labelled 'interpreter'](/files/2016/12/oo-03.png)
{: .centred-image .full-image }

A class is like the example sheet music: it describes how objects look like, and
you can even see how they'll behave when you look at the descriptions, but you
can't *use* the those descriptions directly, you must interpret the descriptions
first to generate an object, which you can then use. In most languages this is
done by a syntax similar to `new TheClass()`, and the process is commonly
referred to as *instantiating*.

The actual syntax for this varies quite a bit in class-based languages, so here
are how one would create an object representing the number `1` in some major
languages supporting this form:

<ul class="tabs">
  <li><a href="#javascript" class="active">JavaScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="#java">Java</a></li>
  <li><a href="#python">Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="#smalltalk">Smalltalk</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ruby">Ruby</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cpp">C++</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="tab-contents">
  <div data-language="javascript" class="active">
{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// Tells the language how 1 objects look like
function One() {
  /* Called when this class is instantiated */
}

One.prototype.describe = function() {
  return '1';
};

One.prototype.isGreaterThanZero = function() {
  return true;
};

One.prototype.isGreaterThanTwo = function() {
  return false;
};

// Or more concisely, from the 2015 version onwards, as:
class One {
  constructor() {
    /* Called when this class is instantiated */
  }
  
  describe() {
    return '1';
  }
  
  isGreaterThanZero() {
    return true;
  }
  
  isGreaterThanTwo() {
    return false;
  }
}

// Interprets the previous definitions to construct a 1 object
const one = new One();
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  
  <div data-language="java">
{% highlight java linenos=table %}
public class Main {
  // Tells the language how 1 objects look like
  class One {
    public One() {
      /* Called when this class is instantiated */
    }
    
    public String describe() {
      return "1";
    }
    
    public boolean isGreaterThanZero() {
      return true;
    }
    
    public boolean isGreaterThanTwo() {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  public void main([]String args) {
    // Interprets the previous definitions to construct a 1 object
    One one = new One();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  
  <div data-language="python">
{% highlight python linenos=table %}
# Tells the language how 1 objects look like
class One(object):
  def __init__(self):

  def describe(self):
    return "1"
    
  def is_greater_than_zero(self):
    return True
    
  def is_greater_than_two(self):
    return False
    
# Interprets the previous definitions to construct a 1 object
one = One()
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  
  <div data-language="smalltalk">
Because Smalltalk languages tend to define programs in a visual, live
environment, there tends to be no syntax to do so from a REPL or such. The
syntax shown above is the convention for Pharo Smalltalk, but is not the <em>text</em>
you type in your program — you instead click buttons in the interface to do
things.
  
{% highlight smalltalk linenos=table %}
"Tells the language how 1 objects look like"
Object subclass: #One
  instanceVariableNames: ''
  classVariableNames: ''
  package: ''.
  
One>>initialize
  "Called when this class is instantiated".
  
One>>describe
  ^ '1'.
  
One>>isGreaterThanZero
  ^ true.
  
One>>isGreaterThanTwo
  ^ false.
  
"Interprets the previous definitions to construct a 1 object"
| one |

one := One.new
{% endhighlight %}

Here's how the interface for editing Pharo classes looks like, with the
definitions above:

  <div data-language="ruby">
{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
# Tells the language how 1 objects look like
class One
  def initialize
    # Called when this class is instantiated
  end
  
  def describe
    '1'
  end
  
  def isGreaterThanZero?
    true
  end
  
  def isGreaterThanTwo?
    false
  end
end

# Interprets the previous definitions to construct a 1 object
one = One.new
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  
  <div data-language="cpp">
{% highlight cpp linenos=table %}
class One {
  public:
    One();
    string describe();
    bool isGreaterThanZero();
    bool isGreaterThanTwo();
}

One::One() {
  // called when this class is instantiated
}

One::describe() {
  return "1";
}

One::isGreaterThanZero() {
  return true;
}

One::isGreaterThanTwo() {
  return false;
}

int main() {
  // Interprets the previous definitions to construct a 1 object
  One one;
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

Even without looking at languages that diverge more from the syntax above, like
[CLOS][], [Eiffel][], [Beta][], [Dylan][], [Factor][], among several others, we
can see already that even within relatively popular object-oriented languages
the syntax for how you provide class definitions and instantiate them can vary
quite a bit. But the *process* is still the same: you first tell the system how
to construct a particular kind of object, then you ask the system to run those
definitions to construct an object for you.

With classes there's no way of getting an object directly, one must always go
through a class first. JavaScript (which was mentione above) is a bit of a
special case here, and we'll discuss it in more depth in the next sections.


### 3.2. The Prototype-based School

Another relatively popular model is the *prototype-based* object model, with
JavaScript being one of the most well known languages supporting such. In this
model one constructs objects directly, and objects may be based on existing
objects.

To put it in more concrete terms, imagine I'm trying to create a new dish —
because I love potatoes, and I want to draw food. I have some ideas for possibly
interesting tastes in my head, but obviously I don't know the exact steps to get
to that taste yet, so I'm just going to “learn by doing” — try everything and
see what tastes good!

![A drawing of steps for preparing Hasselback potatoes](/files/2016/12/oo-05.png)
{: .centred-image .full-image }

Okay, so how exactly is this different from the class-based model? Well, in this
example we have someone cooking potatoes, but all of the things they are
manipulating are *concrete* — those are actual potatoes, not descriptions of a
potato, you can bite them at any time and taste them. So, while working with
prototypes is more like cooking directly, working with classes is more like
writing a recipe, then following the steps in that recipe precisely. None the
less, the end result is pretty much the same from the point of view of how you
use it.

Below are some examples of constructing objects in different languages
supporting the prototype-based model.

<ul class="tabs">
  <li><a href="#javascript" class="active">JavaScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="#lua">Lua</a></li>
  <li><a href="#self">Self</a></li>
  <li><a href="#io">Io</a></li>
  <li><a href="#siren">Siren</a></li>
  <li><a href="#elm">Elm</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="tab-contents">
  <div data-language="javascript" class="active">
{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// Construct a 1 object (for now empty)
const one = {};

// Extend the 1 object to support describing itself
one.describe = function() {
  return '1';
};

// Extend the 1 object to support comparing to 0
one.isGreaterThanZero = function() {
  return true;
};

// Extend the 1 object to support comparing to 2
one.isGreaterThanTwo = function() {
  return false;
};

// Alternatively one may construct an object 
// and its methods as such:
const one = {
  describe() {
    return '1';
  },
  
  isGreaterThanZero() {
    return true;
  },
  
  isGreaterThanTwo() {
    return false;
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  
  <div data-language="lua">
{% highlight lua linenos=table %}
-- Construct a 1 object (for now empty)
one = {}

-- Extend the 1 object to support describing itself
function one:describe()
  return '1'
end

-- Extend the 1 object to support comparing to 0
function one:isGreaterThanZero()
  return true
end

-- Extend the 1 object to support comparing to 2
function one:isGreaterThanTwo()
  return false
end
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  
  <div data-language="self">
Self, as Smalltalk, uses a live environment where users are supposed to
manipulate objects directly. However, Self does have textual syntax for
introducing objects:

{% highlight smalltalk linenos=table %}
"Constructs an 1 object"
(|
  "How to describe this object"
  describe = (^ '1').
  
  "Compares to 0"
  isGreaterThanZero = (^ true).
  
  "Compares to 2"
  isGreaterThanTwo = (^ false).
|)
{% endhighlight %}

In order to add this object to the system, the programmer would find the object
where it should live (for example, the lobby — the global namespace in Self),
and add a new slot to that object. All of this is done by manipulating concrete
entities on the screen:

// Extend the 1 object to support comparing to 0
one isGreaterThanZero := method(true)

// Extend the 1 object to support comparing to 2
one isGreaterThanTwo := method(false)

// Alternatively one may construct an object
// and define its methods as such:
one := Object clone do(
  describe := method("1")
  isGreaterThanZero := method(true)
  isGreaterThanTwo := method(false)
)
{% endhighlight %}

  <div data-language="siren">
{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
$siren/1

# Constructs an 1 object and define its methods
let one = {
  def self describe = "1".
  def self is-greater-than-zero? = true.
  def self is-greater-than-two? = false.
}.
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  
  <div data-language="elm">
{% highlight haskell linenos=table %}
-- Elm's extensible records are very similar to
-- objects in prototype-based languages
--
-- Here's the 1 object
one = {
  describe          = "1",
  isGreaterThanZero = True,
  isGreaterThanTwo  = False
}

-- Things get a bit more complicated when self
-- references (`this`) are needed. Elm uses a
-- structural type system, and recursive
-- structural types are not possible.
-- You can, however, pack the record type on
-- a nominal type.
type One = 
  One {
    describe          : One -> String,
    isGreaterThanZero : One -> Bool,
    isGreaterThanTwo  : One -> Bool
  }

-- Objects can still be constructed directly,
-- as long as they're given the appropriate
-- type.
one = 
  One {
    describe          = \self -> "1",
    isGreaterThanZero = \self -> True,
    isGreaterThanTwo  = \self -> False
  }
  
describe (One one) = 
  one.describe (One one)

isGreaterThanZero (One one) = 
  one.isGreaterThanZero (One one)

isGreaterThanTwo (One one) = 
  one.isGreaterThanTwo (One one)
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

Once again the syntax varies quite a bit between all of these languages, but the
concept is the same: you construct objects directly, by telling the system how
they behave. Most prototype-based languages support some kind of iterative
development, where you construct an object then slowly shape it into the thing
it should represent — very similar to cooking, drawing, or skulpting in this
sense. Languages with live environments (like Self and Siren) may only support
iterative development in its IDE, not in the source code.

### 3.3. Classes versus Prototypes

We have seen that, even though class-based models and prototype-based models can
be used to achieve the same result (constructing an object), the process by
which that happens is very different. Furthermore, even if languages share the
same model, that doesn't mean that its semantics and syntax will be similar —
the way classes work in JavaScript, Java, C++, Smalltalk, and Python, to cite a
few, are entirely different. None the less, the basic process is still the same.

But what makes one or other model more appealing? As with many things in
programming, there's not just one answer to “what's better: classes or
prototypes?”, but rather there are many advantages and disadvantages to each
concept that might make one choose one or the other.

Prototypes are a very simple and expressive model, and they work great when you
want users of your language to iterate over a solution by constructing examples
and refining them (for example, in a live or visual development environment),
but efficient implementation of prototypes is difficult, you often wind up
making the choice of whether to care more about CPU time or about memory
consumption (since memory layout is not fixed). Most practical type systems are
also at odds with advanced uses of features prototype-based languages tend to
enable. Things like static analysis and intelligent autocompletion are also
tricky in most implementations of the model.

Classes are a widely used model, and while they aren't simple or powerful, they
are much easier to implement efficiently. A class indirectly defines what
programmers can expect from a set of objects (which plays well with most type
systems), an optimal layout for objects in memory, and can be used by static
analysis (such as intelligent autocompletion) to help the user navigate the
system when writing code. They tend to be a good fit when you want users of your
language to do the work of modelling upfront, as it happens in
specification-driven systems.

We'll see more about classes and prototypes in the next sections, including how
each of these are implemented, and subtle differences in languages like Python.
But before we do that we need to cover a few other concepts in object-oriented
programming, which brings us to…


## 4. Operations in Objects

We've established that objects are values that define which operations they
support, and we've even seen how objects may be constructed. We're missing
something though: what in the world are these “operations” anyway?

![](/files/2016/12/oo-09.png)
{: .pull-right }

Let's go with another useless real-world analogy (have you noticed how much I
like analogies yet?). If I increase the amount of light incinding on a pupil,
then that pupil will constrict. Conversely, if I decrease the amount of light,
that pupil will dilate. On the other hand, if I increase or decrease the amount
of light inciding on a piece of paper, the piece of paper does not react in any
observable way.

There are a few different concepts to unpack here, so let's see each one in
turn. First, increasing or decrasing the amount of light is a stimulus, each one
being a different stimuli. An entity (or receiver) may or may not acknowledge a
particular stimulus. Pupils acknowledge increasing or decreasing the amount of
light, whereas papers do not. When an entity acknowledges a stimulus, it
performs a reaction to it. In this case, the pupil constricting or dilating are
reactions.

In programming, these reactions are operations that an object may perform, and
different languages give them different names (methods, functions, procedures,
and actions are some of those names). In order for these operations to be
performed, one must first tell the object which operation they'd like to happen.
In a programming language, a programmer may "call a method on" or "send a
message to" and object to do so, and this is the equivalent of the stimuli.

Like in our example, a programmer may use any stimuli it wants, and how to react
to that depends solely on the object that's receiving it. 

{% highlight ruby %}
   pupil .  increase_light()
# `--+-´   `------+------´
#    |            |
#  object      message


   paper .  increase_light()
# `--+-´   `------+------´
#    |            |
#  object      message
{% endhighlight %}

Here the stimulus (which we'll call “message” from now on) is the same:
`increase_light`, but the object receiving (or the “receiver”) it is different.
In the first case, the receiver is the `pupil`, and in the second case the
receiver is the `paper`. When we send the message `increase_light` to the pupil,
it responds by constricting itself. On the other hand, when we send the message
`increase_light` to the paper, nothing happens — the paper does not understand
that message.

Here are some examples of how sending a message to an object happeen in
different languages:

"Self allows the receiver to be implicit, so something
 like `foo` or `foo: 1 bar: 2` assume that the receiver
 of those messages is the receiver for the current

; In CLOS, message sends are just regular function calls.
; As a Lisp, it uses the `(func-name arg1 arg2 arg3 …)`
; syntax (S-expressions). `func-name` (in this case 
; `increase_light`) has to be a function in the local
; scope. Functions select which implementation to run
; based on which arguments were provided to them.
; We'll see more about this in Multimethods.

   $pupil    ->   increase_light  ( )

//   |       |           |         |
// object  syntax     message    arguments


// Note that PHP has namespaces. While the
// syntax for calling a function in a namespace
// is similar to the one above (replacing `->` by `\`),
// namespaces are not first-class, and thus
// it's not a message send.

   Thing\increase_light()
// `---------+----------´
//           |
// regular function call

?>

Let's break this process into smaller, independent concepts. In order to send a
message to an object we need to:

  1. Determine which object is receiving the message (the “receiver”). For
     `pupil.increase_light()`, the receiver would be `pupil`;
  2. Figure out which message we're sending. In this case, `increase_light` with
     no arguments;
  3. Figure out which operation the object understands by the message;
  4. Perform the operation with the provided arguments.
  
  
The combination of these steps is called **dispatch**. When these steps are
performed at compile time, the entire thing is called **static dispatch**. When
these steps are performed at runtime, the entire thing is called **dynamic
dispatch**. We'll see more about this later.

    [William Cook describes the idea of objects as values that determine which operations they support in more details in his blog post][cook-oo].
    His literal definition, “objects are first-class, dynamically dispatched
    behaviours” can be more difficult to understand for people who are not
    familiar with PL terminology, and his clarifications of that statement also
    assume a fair bit of knowledge of such terminology, as well as different
    object-oriented languages.
