<p>
JavaScript is an object oriented (OO) language, with its roots in the <a href="http://selflanguage.org/">Self</a>
programming language, although it's (sadly) designed to look like Java. This
makes the language's really powerful and sweet features stay covered by
some pretty ugly and counter-intuitive <i>work-arounds</i>.
</p>
<p>
One such affected feature is the implementation of prototypical
inheritance. The concepts are simple yet flexible and powerful. It makes
inheritance and behaviourism first-class citizens, just like functions
are first-class in functional-ish languages (JavaScript included).
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript 5</a> has gotten plenty of things to move the
language in the right way, and it's on those sweet features that this article
will expand. I'll also cover the drawbacks of JavaScript's
design, and do a little comparison with the classical model here and
there, where those would highlight the advantages or disadvantages of
the language's implementation of prototypical OO.
</p>
<p>
It's important to note, though, that this article assumes you have
knowledge over other basic JavaScript functionality, like functions
(including the concepts of closures and first-class functions),
primitive values, operators and such.
</p>


<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">1. Objects</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Everything you can manipulate in JavaScript is an object. This includes
<code>Strings</code>, <code>Arrays</code>, <code>Numbers</code>, <code>Functions</code>, and, obviously, the
so-called <code>Object</code> — there are primitives, but they're converted to an
object when you need to operate upon them. An object in the language is
simply a collection of key/value pairs (and some internal magic
sometimes).
</p>
<p>
There are no concepts of classes anywhere, though. That is, an object
with properties <code>name: Linda, age: 21</code> is not an instance of the
<code>Object</code> class (or any class). Both <code>Object</code> and <code>Linda</code> are instances of
themselves. They define their own behaviour, directly. There are no
layers of meta-data (i.e.: classes) to dictate what given object must
look like.
</p>
<p>
You might ask: "how?"; more so if you come from a highly classically
Object Orientated language (like Java or C#). "Wouldn't having each
object defining their own behaviour, instead of a common <i>class</i> mean that
if I have 100 objects, I will have 100 different methods? Also, isn't it
dangerous? How would one know if an object is really an Array, for
example?"
</p>
<p>
Well, to answer all those questions, we'll first need to unlearn
everything about the classical OO approach and start from the ground
up. But, trust me, it's worth it.
</p>
<p>
The prototypical OO model brings in some new ways of solving old
problems, in an more dynamic and expressive way. It also presents new
and more powerful models for extensibility and code-reuse, which is what
most people are interested about when they talk about Object
Orientation. It does not, however, give you contracts. Thus, there are
no static guarantees that an object <code>X</code> will always have a given set of
properties, but to understand the trade-offs here, we'll need to know
what we're talking about first.

<h3 id="sec-1-1">1.1. What are objects?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
As mentioned previously, objects are simple pairs of unique keys that
correspond to a value — we'll call this pair a <code>property</code>. So, suppose
you'd want to describe a few aspects of an old friend (say <code>Mikhail</code>),
like age, name and gender:
</p>

</p>
<p>
Objects are created in JavaScript using the <code>Object.create</code> function. It
takes a parent and an optional set of property descriptors and makes a
brand new instance. We'll not worry much about the parameters
now.
</p>
<p>
An empty object is an object with no parent, and no properties. The
syntax to create such object in JavaScript is the following:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
var mikhail = Object.create(null)
{% endhighlight %}


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">1.2. Creating properties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">


<p>
So, now we have an object, but no properties — we've got to fix that if
we want to describe <code>Mikhail</code>.
</p>
<p>
Properties in JavaScript are dynamic. That means that they can be
created or removed at any time. Properties are also unique, in the sense
that a property key inside an object correspond to exactly one value.
</p>
<p>
Creating new properties is done through the <code>Object.defineProperty</code>
function, which takes a reference to an object, the name of the property
to create and a descriptor that defines the semantics of the property.
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
Object.defineProperty(mikhail, 'name', { value:        'Mikhail'
                                       , writable:     true
                                       , configurable: true
                                       , enumerable:   true })

Object.defineProperty(mikhail, 'age', { value:        19
                                      , writable:     true
                                      , configurable: true
                                      , enumerable:   true })

Object.defineProperty(mikhail, 'gender', { value:        'Male'
                                         , writable:     true
                                         , configurable: true
                                         , enumerable:   true })
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
<code>Object.defineProperty</code> will create a new property if a property with
the given key does not exist in the object, otherwise it'll update the
semantics and value of the existing property.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>By the way</dt><dd>
<p>
  You can also use the <code>Object.defineProperties</code> when you need to add
  more than one property to an object:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
Object.defineProperties(mikhail, { name:   { value:        'Mikhail'
                                           , writable:     true
                                           , configurable: true
                                           , enumerable:   true }

                                 , age:    { value:        19
                                           , writable:     true
                                           , configurable: true
                                           , enumerable:   true }

                                 , gender: { value:        'Male'
                                           , writable:     true
                                           , configurable: true
                                           , enumerable:   true }})
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
  Obviously, both calls are overtly verbose — albeit also quite
  configurable —, thus not really meant for end-user code. It's better
  to create an abstraction layer on top of them.

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">1.3. Descriptors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">


<p>
The little objects that carry the semantics of a property are called descriptors
(we used them in the previous <code>Object.defineProperty</code> calls). Descriptors can be
one of two types - data descriptors or accessor descriptors.
</p>
<p>
Both types of descriptor contain flags, which define how a property is 
treated in the language. If a flag is not set, it's assumed to be <code>false</code> —
unfortunately this is usually not a good default value for them, which
adds to the verbosity of these descriptors.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>writable</dt><dd>
<p>
  Whether the concrete value of the property may be changed. Only
  applies to data descriptors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>configurable</dt><dd>
<p>
  Whether the type of descriptor may be changed, or if the property can
  be removed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>enumerable</dt><dd>
<p>
  Whether the property is listed in a loop through the properties of the
  object.
</p></dd>
</dl>



<p>
Data descriptors are those that hold concrete values, and therefore have 
an additional <code>value</code> parameter, describing the concrete data bound to 
the property:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>value</dt><dd>
<p>
  The value of a property.
</p></dd>
</dl>



<p>
Accessor descriptors, on the other hand, proxy access to the concrete value
through getter and setter functions. When not set, they'll default to 
<code>undefined</code>. 
</p>
<dl>
<dt>get ()</dt><dd>
<p>
  A function called with no arguments when the property value is
  requested.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>set (new_value)</dt><dd>
<p>
  A function called with the new value for the property when the user
  tries to modify the value of the property.
</p></dd>
</dl>



</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4">1.4. Ditching the verbosity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">


<p>
Luckily, property descriptors are not the only way of working with
properties in JavaScript, they can also be handled in a simple and concise
way.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript also understands references to a property using what we call
<i>bracket notation</i>. The general rule is:
</p>

{% highlight hs linenos=table %}
<bracket-access> ::= <identifier> "[" <expression> "]"
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Where <code>identifier</code> is the variable that holds the object containing the
properties we want to access, and <code>expression</code> is any valid JavaScript
expression that defines the name of the property. There are no
constraints in which name a property can have<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, everything is fair
game.
</p>
<p>
Thus, we could just as well rewrite our previous example as:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
mikhail['name']   = 'Mikhail'
mikhail['age']    = 19
mikhail['gender'] = 'Male'
{% endhighlight %}

> <strong class="heading">Note</strong>
> All property names are ultimately converted to a String, such that `object[1]`, `object[⁣[1]⁣]`, `object['1']` and `object[variable]` (when the variable resolves to `1`) are all equivalent.
{: .note}



<p>
There is another way of referring to a property called <i>dot notation</i>, which
usually looks less cluttered and is easier to read than the bracket
alternative. However, it only works when the property name is a
<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x7.6">valid JavaScript IdentifierName</a><sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>, and doesn't allow for arbitrary expressions
(so, variables here are a no-go).
</p>
<p>
The rule for <i>dot notation</i> is:
</p>


{% highlight hs linenos=table %}
<dot-access> ::= <identifier> "." <identifier-name>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This would give us an even sweeter way of defining properties:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
mikhail.name   = 'Mikhail'
mikhail.age    = 19
mikhail.gender = 'Male'
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Both of these syntaxes are equivalent to creating a data property, with
all semantic flags set to <code>true</code>.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5">1.5. Accessing properties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">


<p>
Retrieving the values stored in a given property is as easy as creating
new ones, and the syntax is mostly similar as well — the only difference
being there isn't an assignment.
</p>
<p>
So, if we want to check on Mikhail's age:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
mikhail['age']
// => 19
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Trying to access a property that does not exist in the object simply
returns <code>undefined</code> <sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
mikhail['address']
// => undefined
{% endhighlight %}


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-6">1.6. Removing properties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">


<p>
To remove entire properties from an object, JavaScript provides the
<code>delete</code> operator. So, if you wanted to remove the <code>gender</code> property
from the <code>mikhail</code> object:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
delete mikhail['gender']
// => true

mikhail['gender']
// => undefined
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
The <code>delete</code> operator returns <code>true</code> if the property was removed,
<code>false</code> otherwise. I won't delve into details of the workings of this
operator, since <a href="http://twitter.com/kangax">@kangax</a> has already written a
<a href="http://perfectionkills.com/understanding-delete/">most awesome article on how delete works</a>.

<div id="outline-container-1-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-7">1.7. Getters and setters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">


<p>
Getters and setters are usually used in classical object oriented
languages to provide encapsulation. They are not much needed in
JavaScript, though, given how dynamic the language is — <del>and my bias against the feature</del>.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, they allow you to proxy the requests for reading a property
value or setting it, and decide how to handle each situation. So,
suppose we had separate slots for our object's first and last name, but
wanted a simple interface for reading and setting it.
</p>
<p>
First, let's set the first and last names of our friend, as concrete
data properties:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
Object.defineProperty(mikhail, 'first_name', { value:    'Mikhail'
                                             , writable: true })

Object.defineProperty(mikhail, 'last_name', { value:    'Weiß'
                                            , writable: true })
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Then we can define a common way of accessing and setting both of those
values at the same time — let's call it <code>name</code>:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// () → String
// Returns the full name of object.
function get_full_name() {
    return this.first_name + ' ' + this.last_name
}

// (new_name:String) → undefined
// Sets the name components of the object, from a full name.
function set_full_name(new_name) { var names
    names = new_name.trim().split(/\s+/)
    this.first_name = names[⁣'0'] || ''
    this.last_name  = names['1'] || ''
}

Object.defineProperty(mikhail, 'name', { get: get_full_name
                                       , set: set_full_name
                                       , configurable: true
                                       , enumerable:   true })
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Now, every-time we try to access the value of Mikhail's <code>name</code> property,
it'll execute the <code>get_full_name</code> getter.
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
mikhail.name
// => 'Mikhail Weiß'

mikhail.first_name
// => 'Mikhail'

mikhail.last_name
// => 'Weiß'

mikhail.last_name = 'White'
mikhail.name
// => 'Mikhail White'
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
We can also set the name of the object, by assigning a value to the
property, this will then execute <code>set_full_name</code> to do the dirty work.
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
mikhail.name = 'Michael White'

mikhail.name
// => 'Michael White'

mikhail.first_name
// => 'Michael'

mikhail.last_name
// => 'White'
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Of course, getters and setters make property access and modification
<a href="http://jsperf.com/getter-setter/8">fairly slower</a>. They do have some use-cases, but while browsers don't
optimise them better, methods seem to be the way to go.
</p>
<p>
Also, it should be noted that while getters and setters are usually used
for encapsulation in other languages, in ECMAScript 5 you still can't have
such if you need the information to be stored in the object itself. All
properties in an object are public.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-8">1.8. Listing properties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">


<p>
Since properties are dynamic, JavaScript provides a way of checking out
which properties an object defines. There are two ways of listing the
properties of an object, depending on what kind of properties one is
interested into.
</p>
<p>
The first one is done through a call to <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames</code>,
which returns an <code>Array</code> containing the names of <b>all</b> properties set
directly in the object — we call these kind of property <b>own</b>, by the
way.
</p>
<p>
If we check now what we know about Mikhail:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(mikhail)
// => [ 'name', 'age', 'gender', 'first_name', 'last_name' ]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The second way is using <code>Object.keys</code>, which returns all own properties
that have been marked as <b>enumerable</b> when they were defined:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
Object.keys(mikhail)
// => [ 'name', 'age', 'gender' ]
{% endhighlight %}


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-9">1.9. Object literals</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">


<p>
An even easier way of defining objects is to use the object literal
(also called <i>object initialiser</i>) syntax that JavaScript provides. An
object literal denotes a fresh object, that has its parent as the
<code>Object.prototype</code> object. We'll talk more about parents when we visit
inheritance, later on.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, the object literal syntax allows you to define simple
objects and initialise it with properties at the same time. So, we could
rewrite our Mikhail object to the following:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
var mikhail = { first_name: 'Mikhail'
              , last_name:  'Weiß'
              , age:        19
              , gender:     'Male'

              // () → String
              // Returns the full name of object.
              , get name() {
                    return this.first_name + ' ' + this.last_name }

              // (new_name:String) → undefined
              // Sets the name components of the object,
              // from a full name.
              , set name(new_name) { var names
                    names = new_name.trim().split(/\s+/)
                    this.first_name = names['0'] || ''
                    this.last_name  = names['1'] || '' }
              }
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Property names that are not valid identifiers must be quoted. Also note
that the getter/setter notation for object literals strictly defines a
new anonymous function. If you want to assign a previously declared
function to a getter/setter, you need to use the <code>Object.defineProperty</code>
function.
</p>
<p>
The rules for object literal can be described as the following:
</p>


{% highlight hs linenos=table %}
<object-literal>  ::= "{" <property-list> "}"
                    ;
<property-list>   ::= <property> ["," <property>]*
                    ;
<property>        ::= <data-property>
                    | <getter-property>
                    | <setter-property>
                    ;
<data-property>   ::= <property-name> ":" <expression>
                    ;
<getter-property> ::= "get" <identifier>
                    :       <function-parameters>
                    :       <function-block>
                    ;
<setter-property> ::= "set" <identifier>
                    :       <function-parameters>
                    :       <function-block>
                    ;
<property-name>   ::= <identifier>
                    | <quoted-identifier>
                    ;
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Object literals can only appear inside expressions in
JavaScript. Since the syntax is ambiguous to block statements in the
language, new-comers usually confound the two:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// This is a block statement, with a label:
{ foo: 'bar' }
// => 'bar'

// This is a syntax error (labels can't be quoted):
{ "foo": 'bar' }
// => SyntaxError: Invalid label

// This is an object literal (note the parenthesis to force
// parsing the contents as an expression):
({ "foo": 'bar' })
// => { foo: 'bar' }

// Where the parser is already expecting expressions,
// object literals don't need to be forced. E.g.:
var x = { foo: 'bar' }
fn({foo: 'bar'})
return { foo: 'bar' }
1, { foo: 'bar' }
( ... )
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Up until now, the Mikhail object only defined slots of concrete data —
with the exception of the name getter/setter. Defining actions that may
be performed on a certain object in JavaScript is just as simple.
</p>
<p>
This is because JavaScript does not differentiate how you can manipulate
a <code>Function</code>, a <code>Number</code> or an <code>Object</code>. Everything is treated the same
way (i.e.: functions in JavaScript are first-class).
</p>
<p>
As such, to define an action for a given object, you just assign a
function object reference to a property. Let's say we wanted a way for
Mikhail to greet someone:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// (person:String) → String
// Greets a random person
mikhail.greet = function(person) {
    return this.name + ': Why, hello there, ' + person + '.'
}

After setting the property, we can use it the same way we used the
concrete data that were assigned to the object. That is, accessing the
property will return a reference to the function object stored there, so
we can just call.

<h3 id="sec-2-1">2.1. Dynamic <code>this</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">


<p>
One thing that you must have noticed both in the <code>greet</code> function, and
the functions we've used for the <code>name</code>'s getter/setter, is that they
use a magical variable called <code>this</code>.
</p>
<p>
It holds a reference to the object that the function is being applied
to. This doesn't necessarily means that <code>this</code> will equal the object
where the function is <b>stored</b>. No, JavaScript is not so
selfish. 
</p>
<p>
Functions are generics. That is, in JavaScript, what <code>this</code> refers to is
decided dynamically, at the time the function is called, and depending
only on how such a function is called.
</p>
<p>
Having <code>this</code> dynamically resolved is an incredible powerful mechanism
for the dynamism of JavaScript's object orientation and lack of
strictly enforced structures (i.e.: classes), this means one can apply a
function to any object that meets the requirements of the actions it
performs, regardless of how the object has been constructed — hack in
some custom multiple dispatcher and you have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">CLOS</a>.

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">2.2. How <code>this</code> is resolved</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
There are four different ways of resolving the <code>this</code> variable in a
function, depending on how a function is called: directly; as a method;
explicitly applied; as a constructor. We'll dive in the first three for
now, and come back at constructors later on.
</p>
<p>
For the following examples, we'll take these definitions into account:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// (other:Number[, yet_another:Number]) → Number
// Returns the sum of the object's value with the given Number
function add(other, yet_another) {
    return this.value + other + (yet_another || 0)
}

var one = { value: 1, add: add }
var two = { value: 2, add: add }
{% endhighlight %}



</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2-1">2.2.1. Called as a method</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">


<p>
If a function is called as an object's method, then <code>this</code> inside the
function will refer to the object. That is, when we explicitly state
that an object is carrying an action, then that object will be our
<code>this</code> inside the function.
</p>
<p>
This is what happened when we called <code>mikhail.greet()</code>. The property
access at the time of the call tells JavaScript that we want to apply
whatever actions the <code>greet</code> function defines to the <code>mikhail</code> object.
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
one.add(two.value) // this === one
// => 3

two.add(3)         // this === two
// => 5

one['add'](two.value) // brackets are cool too
// => 3
{% endhighlight %}



</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2-2">2.2.2. Called directly</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">


<p>
When a function is called directly, <code>this</code> will be resolved to the
global object in the engine (e.g.: <code>window</code> in browsers, <code>global</code> in
Node.js)
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
add(two.value)  // this === global
// => NaN

// The global object still has no `value' property, let's fix that.
value = 2
add(two.value)  // this === global
// => 4
{% endhighlight %}

<h4 id="sec-2-2-3">2.2.3. Explicitly applied</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-3">


<p>
Finally, a function may be explicitly applied to any object, regardless
of whether the object has the function stored as a property or
not. These applications are done through a either the <code>call</code> or <code>apply</code>
method of a function object.
</p>
<p>
The difference between these two methods is the way they take in the
parameters that will be passed to the function, and the performance —
<code>apply</code> being up to 55x slower than a direct call, whereas <code>call</code> is
usually not as bad. This might vary greatly depending on the engine
though, so it's always better to do a <a href="http://jsperf.com">Perf test</a> rather than being scared
of using the functionality — don't optimise early!
</p>
<p>
Anyways, <code>call</code> expects the object that the function will be applied to
as the first parameter, and the parameters to apply to the function as
positional arguments:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
add.call(two, 2, 2)      // this === two
// => 6

add.call(window, 4)      // this === global
// => 6

add.call(one, one.value) // this === one
// => 2
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
On the other hand, <code>apply</code> lets you pass an array of parameters as the
second parameter of the function. The array will be passed as positional
arguments to the target function:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
add.apply(two, [2, 2])       // equivalent to two.add(2, 2)
// => 6

add.apply(window, [ 4 ])       // equivalent to add(4)
// => 6

add.apply(one, [one.value])  // equivalent to one.add(one.value)
// => 2
{% endhighlight %}


<dl>
<dt>Note</dt><dd>
<p>
  What <code>this</code> resolves to when applying a function to <code>null</code> or
  <code>undefined</code> depends on the semantics used by the engine. Usually, it
  would be the same as explicitly applying the function to the global
  object. But if the engine is running on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Strict_mode">strict mode</a>, then <code>this</code> will
  be resolved as expected — to the exact thing it was applied to:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
window.value = 2
add.call(undefined, 1) // this === window
// => 3

void function() {
  "use strict"
  add.call(undefined, 1) // this === undefined
  // => NaN
  // Since primitives can't hold properties.
}()

Aside from the dynamic nature of functions in JavaScript, there is also
a way of making a function bound to an specific object, such that <code>this</code>
inside that function will always resolve to the given object, regardless
of whether it's called as that object's method or directly.
</p>
<p>
The function that provides such functionality is <code>bind</code>. It takes an
object, and additional parameters (in the same manner as <code>call</code>), and
returns a new function that will apply those parameters to the original
function when called:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}

<h2 id="sec-3">3. Inheritance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
Up to this point we have seen how objects can define their own
behaviours, and how we can reuse (by explicit application) actions in
other objects, however, this still doesn't give us a nice way for
code reuse and extensibility.
</p>
<p>
That's where inheritance comes into play. Inheritance allows for a
greater separation of concerns, where objects define specialised
behaviours by building upon the behaviours of other objects.
</p>
<p>
The prototypical model goes further than that, though, and allows for
selective extensibility, behaviour sharing and other interesting
patterns we'll explore in a bit. Sad thing is: the specific model of
prototypical OO implemented by JavaScript is a bit limited, so
circumventing these limitations to accommodate these patterns will bring
in a bit of overhead sometimes.
</p>


</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">3.1. Prototypes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">


<p>
Inheritance in JavaScript revolves around cloning the behaviours of an
object and extending it with specialised behaviours. The object that has
it's behaviours cloned is called <b>Prototype</b> (not to be confounded with
the <code>prototype</code> property of functions).
</p>
<p>
A prototype is just a plain object, that happens to share it's
behaviours with another object — it acts as the object's parent.
</p>
<p>
Now, the concepts of this <i>behaviour cloning</i> does not imply that you'll
have two different copies of the same function, or data. In fact,
JavaScript implements inheritance by delegation, all properties are kept
in the parent, and access to them is just extended for the child.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned previously, the parent (or <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code>) of an object is
defined by making a call to <code>Object.create</code>, and passing a reference of
the object to use as parent in the first parameter.
</p>
<p>
This would come well in our example up until now. For example, the
greeting and name actions can be well defined in a separate object and
shared with other objects that need them.
</p>
<p>
Which takes us to the following model:
</p>


<p>
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4429200/blog/oop-proto-person.png"  alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4429200/blog/oop-proto-person.png" />
</p>
<p>
We can implement this in JavaScript with the following definitions:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
var person = Object.create(null)

// Here we are reusing the previous getter/setter functions
Object.defineProperty(person, 'name', { get: get_full_name
                                      , set: set_full_name
                                      , configurable: true
                                      , enumerable:   true })

// And adding the `greet' function
person.greet = function (person) {
    return this.name + ': Why, hello there, ' + person + '.'
}

// Then we can share those behaviours with Mikhail
// By creating a new object that has it's [[Prototype]] property
// pointing to `person'.
var mikhail = Object.create(person)
mikhail.first_name = 'Mikhail'
mikhail.last_name  = 'Weiß'
mikhail.age        = 19
mikhail.gender     = 'Male'

// And we can test whether things are actually working.
// First, `name' should be looked on `person'
mikhail.name
// => 'Mikhail Weiß'

// Setting `name' should trigger the setter
mikhail.name = 'Michael White'

// Such that `first_name' and `last_name' now reflect the
// previously name setting.
mikhail.first_name
// => 'Michael'
mikhail.last_name
// => 'White'

// `greet' is also inherited from `person'.
mikhail.greet('you')
// => 'Michael White: Why, hello there, you.'

// And just to be sure, we can check which properties actually
// belong to `mikhail'
Object.keys(mikhail)
// => [ 'first_name', 'last_name', 'age', 'gender' ]

<h3 id="sec-3-2">3.2. How <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> works</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">


<p>
As you could see from the previous example, none of the properties
defined in <code>Person</code> have flown to the <code>Mikhail</code> object, and yet we could
access them just fine. This happens because JavaScript implements
delegated property access, that is, a property is searched through all
parents of an object.
</p>
<p>
This parent chain is defined by a hidden slot in every object, called
<code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code>. You can't change this slot directly<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>, so the only
way of setting it is when you're creating a fresh object.
</p>
<p>
When a property is requested from the object, the engine first tries to
retrieve the property from the target object. If the property isn't
there, the search continue through the immediate parent of that object,
and the parent of that parent, and so on.
</p>
<p>
This means that we can change the behaviours of a prototype at run time,
and have it reflected in all objects that inherit from it. For example,
let's suppose we wanted a different default greeting:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// (person:String) → String
// Greets the given person
person.greet = function(person) {
    return this.name + ': Harro, ' + person + '.'
}

mikhail.greet('you')
// => 'Michael White: Harro, you.'
{% endhighlight %}

<div id="outline-container-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3">3.3. Overriding properties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">

<p>So, prototypes (that is, inheritance) are used for sharing data with
other objects, and it does such in a pretty fast and memory-effective
manner too, since you'll always have only one instance of a given piece
of data lying around.
</p>
<p>
Now what if we want to add specialised behaviours, that build upon the
data that was shared with the object? Well, we have seen before that
objects define their own behaviours by means of properties, so
specialised behaviours follow the same principle — you just assign a
value to the relevant property.
</p>
<p>
To better demonstrate it, suppose <code>Person</code> implements only a general
greeting, and everyone inheriting from <code>Person</code> define their own
specialised and unique greetings. Also, let's add a new person to our
case scenario, so to outline better how objects are extended:
</p>


<p>
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4429200/blog/oop-extend.png"  alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4429200/blog/oop-extend.png" />
</p>
<p>
Note that both <code>mikhail</code> and <code>kristin</code> define their own version of
<code>greet</code>. In this case, whenever we call the <code>greet</code> method on them
they'll use their own version of that behaviour, instead of the one that
was shared from <code>person</code>.
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// Here we set up the greeting for a generic person

// (person:String) → String
// Greets the given person, formally
person.greet = function(person) {
    return this.name + ': Hello, ' + (person || 'you')
}

// And a greeting for our protagonist, Mikhail

// (person:String) → String
// Greets the given person, like a bro
mikhail.greet = function(person) {
    return this.name + ': \'sup, ' + (person || 'dude')
}

// And define our new protagonist, Kristin
var kristin = Object.create(person)
kristin.first_name = 'Kristin'
kristin.last_name  = 'Weiß'
kristin.age        = 19
kristin.gender     = 'Female'

// Alongside with her specific greeting manners

// (person:String) → String
// Greets the given person, sweetly
kristin.greet = function(person) {
    return this.name + ': \'ello, ' + (person || 'sweetie')
}

// Finally, we test if everything works according to the expected

mikhail.greet(kristin.first_name)
// => 'Michael White: \'sup, Kristin'

mikhail.greet()
// => 'Michael White: \'sup, dude'

kristin.greet(mikhail.first_name)
// => 'Kristin Weiß: \'ello, Michael'

// And just so we check how cool this [[Prototype]] thing is,
// let's get Kristin back to the generic behaviour

delete kristin.greet
// => true

kristin.greet(mikhail.first_name)
// => 'Kristin Weiß: Hello, Michael'

<div id="outline-container-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4">3.4. Mixins</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">

<p>Prototypes allow for behaviour sharing in JavaScript, and although they
are undeniably powerful, they aren't quite as powerful as they could
be. For one, prototypes only allow that one object inherit from another
single object, while extending those behaviours as they see fit.
</p>
<p>
However, this approach quickly kills interesting things like behaviour
composition, where we could mix-and-match several objects into one, with
all the advantages highlighted in the prototypical inheritance.
</p>
<p>
Multiple inheritance would also allow the usage of <i>data-parents</i> —
objects that provide an example state that fulfils the requirements for
a given behaviour. Default properties, if you will.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, since we can define behaviours directly on an object in
JavaScript, we can work-around these issues by using mixins — and adding
a little overhead at object's creation time.
</p>
<p>
So, what are mixins anyways? Well, they are parent-less objects. That
is, they fully define their own behaviour, and are mostly designed to be
incorporated in other objects (although you could use their methods
directly).
</p>
<p>
Continuing with our little protagonists' scenario, let's extend it to
add some capabilities to them. Let's say that every person can also be a
<code>pianist</code> or a <code>singer</code>. A given person can have no such abilities, be
just a pianist, just a singer or both. This is the kind of case where
JavaScript's model of prototypical inheritance falls short, so we're
going to cheat a little bit.
</p>


<p>
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4429200/blog/oop-mixins.png"  alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4429200/blog/oop-mixins.png" />
</p>
<p>
For mixins to work, we first need to have a way of combining different
objects into a single one. JavaScript doesn't provide this out-of-the
box, but we can easily make one by copying all <b>own</b> property
descriptors, the ones defined directly in the object, rather than
inherited, from one object to another.
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// Aliases for the rather verbose methods on ES5
var descriptor  = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor
  , properties  = Object.getOwnPropertyNames
  , define_prop = Object.defineProperty

// (target:Object, source:Object) → Object
// Copies properties from `source' to `target'
function extend(target, source) {
    properties(source).forEach(function(key) {
        define_prop(target, key, descriptor(source, key)) })

    return target
}
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Basically, what <code>extend</code> does here is taking two objects — a source and
a target, — iterating over all properties present on the <code>source</code>
object, and copying the property descriptors over to <code>target</code>. Note that
this is a destructive method, meaning that <code>target</code> will be modified
in-place. It's the cheapest way, though, and usually not a problem.
</p>
<p>
Now that we have a method for copying properties over, we can start
assigning multiple abilities to our objects (<code>mikhail</code> e
<code>kristin</code>):
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// A pianist is someone who can `play' the piano
var pianist = Object.create(null)
pianist.play = function() {
    return this.name + ' starts playing the piano.'
}

// A singer is someone who can `sing'
var singer = Object.create(null)
singer.sing = function() {
    return this.name + ' starts singing.'
}

// Then we can move on to adding those abilities to
// our main objects:
extend(mikhail, pianist)
mikhail.play()
// => 'Michael White starts playing the piano.'

// We can see that all that ends up as an own property of
// mikhail. It is not shared.
Object.keys(mikhail)
['first_name', 'last_name', 'age', 'gender', 'greet', 'play']

// Then we can define kristin as a singer
extend(kristin, singer)
kristin.sing()
// => 'Kristin Weiß starts singing.'

// Mikhail can't sing yet though
mikhail.sing()
// => TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'sing'

// But mikhail will inherit the `sing' method if we
// extend the Person prototype with it:
extend(person, singer)

mikhail.sing()
// => 'Michael White starts singing.'
{% endhighlight %}

<div id="outline-container-3-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-5">3.5. Accessing overwritten properties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">

<p>Now that we're able to inherit properties from other objects and extend
the specialised objects to define their own behaviours, we have a little
problem: what if we actually wanted to access the parent behaviours that
we just overwrote?
</p>
<p>
JavaScript provides the <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code> function, that returns
the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> of an object. This way, we have access to all
properties defined within the prototype chain of an object. So,
accessing a property in the parent of an object is quite simple:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
Object.getPrototypeOf(mikhail).name    // same as `person.name'
// => 'undefined undefined'

// We can assert it's really being called on `person' by
// giving `person' a `first_name' and `last_name'
person.first_name = 'Random'
person.last_name  = 'Person'
Object.getPrototypeOf(mikhail).name
// => 'Random Person'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
So, a naïve solution for applying a method stored in the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code>
of an object to the current one, would then follow, quite naturally, by
looking the property on the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> of <code>this</code>:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
var proto = Object.getPrototypeOf

// (name:String) → String
// Greets someone intimately if we know them, otherwise use
// the generic greeting
mikhail.greet = function(name) {
    return name == 'Kristin Weiß'?  this.name + ': Heya, Kristty'
         : /* we dunno this guy */  proto(this).greet.call(this, name)
}

mikhail.greet(kristin.name)
// => 'Michael White: Heya, Kristty'

mikhail.greet('Margareth')
// => 'Michael White: Hello, Margareth'
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
This looks all good and well, but there's a little catch: it will enter
in endless recursion if you try to apply this approach to more than one
parent. This happens because the methods are always applied in the
context of the message's first target, making the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> lookup
resolve always to the same object:
</p>


<p>
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4429200/blog/oop-super.png"  alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4429200/blog/oop-super.png" />
</p>
<p>
The simple solution to this, then, is to make all parent look-ups
static, by passing the object where the current function is stored,
rather than the object that the function was applied to.
</p>
<p>
So, the last example becomes:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
var proto = Object.getPrototypeOf

// (name:String) → String
// Greets someone intimately if we know them, otherwise use
// the generic greeting.
//
// Note that now we explicitly state that the lookup should take
// the parent of `mikhail', so we can be assured the cyclic parent
// resolution above won't happen.
mikhail.greet = function(name) {
    return name == 'Kristin Weiß'?  this.name + ': Heya, Kristty'
         : /* we dunno this guy */  proto(mikhail).greet.call(this, name)
}

mikhail.greet(kristin.name)
// => 'Michael White: Heya, Kristty'

mikhail.greet('Margareth')
// => 'Michael White: Hello, Margareth'
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Still, this has quite some short-commings. First, since the object is
hard-coded in the function, we can't just assign the function to any
object and have it just work, as we did up 'till now. The function would
always resolve to the parent of <code>mikhail</code>, not of the object where it's
stored.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, we can't just apply the function to any object. The function
is not generic anymore. Unfortunately, though, making the parent
resolution dynamic would require us to pass an additional parameter to
every function call, which is something that can't be achieved short of
ugly hacks.
</p>
<p>
The approach proposed for the next version of JavaScript only solves the
first problem, which is the easiest. Here, we'll do the same, by
introducing a new way of defining methods. Yes, methods, not generic
functions.
</p>
<p>
Functions that need to access the properties in the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> will
require an additional information: the object where they are
stored. This makes the lookup static, but solves our cyclic lookup
problem.
</p>
<p>
We do this by introducing a new function — <code>make_method</code> — which creates
a function that passes this information to the target function.
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// (object:Object, fun:Function) → Function
// Creates a method
function make_method(object, fun) {
    return function() { var args
        args = slice.call(arguments)
        args.unshift(object)        // insert `object' as first parameter
        fn.apply(this, args) }
}


// Now, all functions that are expected to be used as a method
// should remember to reserve the first parameter to the object
// where they're stored.
//
// Note that, however, this is a magical parameter introduced
// by the method function, so any function calling the method
// should pass only the usual arguments.
function message(self, message) { var parent
    parent = Object.getPrototypeOf(self)
    if (parent && parent.log)
        parent.log.call(this, message)

    console.log('-- At ' + self.name)
    console.log(this.name + ': ' + message)
}

// Here we define a prototype chain C -> B -> A
var A  = Object.create(null)
A.name = 'A'
A.log  = make_method(A, message)

<h2 id="sec-4">4. Constructors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>Constructor functions are the old pattern for creating objects in
JavaScript, which couple inheritance with initialisation in an
imperative manner.
</p>
<p>
Constructor functions <b>are not</b>, however, a special construct in the
language. Any simple function can be used as a constructor function;
just like <code>this</code>, it all depends on how the function is called.
</p>
<p>
So, what's it about constructor functions, really? Well, every function
object in JavaScript automatically gets a <code>prototype</code> property, that is
a simple object with a <code>constructor</code> property pointing back to the
constructor function. And this object is used to determine the
<code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> of instances created with that constructor function.
</p>
<p>
The following diagram shows the objects for the constructor function
<code>function Person(first_name, last_name)</code>:

<h3 id="sec-4-1">4.1. The <code>new</code> magic</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">

<p>The <code>prototype</code> <i>per se</i> is not a special property, however it gains
special meaning when a constructor function is used in conjunction with
the <code>new</code> statement. As I said before, in this case the <code>prototype</code>
property of the constructor function is used to provide the
<code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> of the instance.
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
// Constructs a new Person
function Person(first_name, last_name) {
    // If the function is called with `new', as we expect
    // `this' here will be the freshly created object
    // with the [[Prototype]] set to Person.prototype
    //
    // Of course, if someone omits new when calling the
    // function, the usual resolution of `this' — as
    // explained before — will take place.
    this.first_name = first_name
    this.last_name  = last_name
}

// (person:String) → String
// Greets the given person
Person.prototype.greet = function(person) {
    return this.name + ': Harro, ' + person + '.' 
}

var person = new Person('Mikhail', 'Weiß')


// We could de-sugar the constructor pattern in the following
// Taking into account that `Person' here means the `prototype'
// property of the `Person' constructor.
var Person = Object.create(Object.prototype)

// (person:String) → String
// Greets the given person
Person.greet = function(person) {
    return this.name + ': Harro, ' + person + '.' 
}

// Here's what the constructor does when called with `new'
var person = Object.create(Person)
person.first_name = 'Mikhail'
person.last_name  = 'Weiß'
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
When a function is called with the <code>new</code> statement, the following magic
happens:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a fresh <code>Object</code>, inheriting from <code>Object.prototype</code>, say <code>{ }</code>

</li>
<li>Set the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> internal property of the new object to point
    to the constructor's <code>prototype</code> property, so it inherits those
    behaviours.

</li>
<li>Call the constructor in the context of this fresh object, such that
    <code>this</code> inside the constructor will be the fresh object, and pass any
    parameters given to the function.

</li>
<li>If the function returns an <code>Object</code>, make that be the return value of
    the function.

</li>
<li>Otherwise, return the fresh object.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
This means that the resulting value of calling a <code>function</code> with the
<code>new</code> operator is not necessarily the object that was created. A
function is free to return any other <code>Object</code> value as it sees fit. This
is an interesting and — to a certain extent — powerful behaviour, but
also a confusing one for many newcomers:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
function Foo() {
    this.foo = 'bar'
}

new Foo()
// => { foo: 'bar' }


function Foo() {
    this.foo = 'bar'
    return Foo
}

new Foo()
// => [Function: Foo]

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>The functions and concepts presented up until now assumed that the code
would be running in an ECMAScript 5 environment, since the new additions
make prototypical inheritance more natural, without the initialisation
and inheritance coupling provided by constructor functions.
</p>
<p>
However, obviously this means that code using these functions will not
work everywhere. <a href="http://twitter.com/kangax">@kangax</a> has a most awesome <a href="http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/">compatibility table</a> for the
implementations that follow ECMAScript 5.
</p>
<p>
This section provides fallbacks to some of the functionality, and point
to libraries that implement these fallbacks so you don't get to reinvent
the wheel. Note that this section only exists to highlight how the
functionality works, and how the core part of those behaviours could be
reproduced in legacy code, it's not meant to provide ready-to-use
fallbacks. Use libraries for that :3

constructor functions can also be used to set the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> link
for the constructed object — which is what we're interested about.
</p>
<p>
A <code>clone</code> function could be defined such that it would create a new
object based on the given prototype:
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}

<p><code>Object.defineProperty</code> and it's batch cousin <code>Object.defineProperties</code>
are also new additions, and they allow properties to be defined with
internal tags, like <code>writable</code>, <code>configurable</code> and <code>enumerable</code>. It's
not possible to get this behaviour in the older versions of the
language.
</p>
<p>
All properties defined otherwise will inevitable have <code>writable</code>,
<code>configurable</code> and <code>enumerable</code> set to true, which is usually not really
that much of a problem — still, not compatible with full ES5 code.
</p>
<p>
In regards of getters and setters, they are supported to a certain
extent with non-standard syntax — the <code>__defineGetter__</code> and
<code>__defineSetter__</code> methods, — but are also not available
everywhere. Most notably, such methods have never been present in IE.

</p>
<p>
This is achieved through the <code>for..in</code> statement, which iterates through
all the enumerable properties of an object, either directly set in the

be used to filter the properties to include only the ones set directly

<h3 id="sec-5-4">5.4. Bound methods</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">

<p>Bound methods in JavaScript do much more than just assert the value of
<code>this</code> inside a function, they can also be used for partial function
applications and behave slightly different when called as a
constructor. For this, we'll just focus on the first two.
</p>
<p>
Basically, when calling the <code>bind</code> method of a function, we're creating
a new function object that has a defined <code>thisObject</code> and perhaps a
defined initial list of arguments. This can be just as well achieved
with a closure to store the given state, and a explicit function
application, through the <code>apply</code> method.
</p>


{% highlight js linenos=table %}
var slice = [].slice

// (fun:Function, bound_this:Object, args...) → Function
//  --> (args...) → *mixed*

    bound_args = slice.call(arguments, 2)

<h3 id="sec-5-5">5.5. Getting the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-5">

<p>For accessing overriden properties, we need to get the a reference to
the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code>. In environments that expose such link (like
Firefox's <i>SpiderMonkey</i> or Chrome's <i>V8</i>), it's easy and reliable:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
function proto(object) {
    return object?            object.__proto__
         : /* not object? */  null
}
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
However, in environments that don't expose the <code>[⁣[Prototype]⁣]</code> link,
things aren't quite as reliable. The only way of getting the prototype
of an object, in this case, would be by the constructor's <code>prototype</code>
property, but we can only access that from the object given the
<code>constructor</code> property is kept intact.
</p>
<p>
A fallback covering most cases would look like this:
</p>

{% highlight js linenos=table %}
function proto(object) {
    return !object?                null
         : '__proto__' in object?  object.__proto__
         : /* not exposed? */      object.constructor.prototype

you pass something that is not an object to it.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-6">


<p>
<a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim">ES5-shim</a> attempts to implement fallbacks for ECMAScript 5 functionality
that can be done in pure JavaScript, whilst adding minimal support
for the other ones. It's important to note, however, that the
fallbacks are intended to provide equivalent functionality that is
close to the ones defined in the specs, it's not guaranteed that they
will work exactly the same way.
</p>
<p>
To quote the <code>README</code>:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"As closely as possible to ES5" is not very close. Many of these shims
are intended only to allow code to be written to ES5 without causing
run-time errors in older engines. In many cases, this means that
these shims cause many ES5 methods to silently fail. Decide carefully
whether this is what you want.

<h2 id="sec-6">6. Wrapping it up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

<p>The object orientation model chosen for JavaScript is definitely one of
the things that makes the language expressive and powerful, however the
really poor semantics from the before-ES5 age quite killed all the fun
about it.
</p>
<p>
With ECMAScript 5, we have got better ways to deal with objects and
inheritance, but most of the API is pretty verbose and awkward to use
out of the box, so abstracting them is the only good way of exploring
all the power of the first-class inheritance model provided by the
language.
</p>
<p>
Once you dwell on the depths of JavaScript's prototypical object
orientation, however, you will find it lacking on aspects that would
otherwise seem like the obvious thing to do — like multiple inheritance
and message resending, but also basic features like an easier object
extension functionality.
</p>
<p>
Luckily most of these issues manage to have a solution, albeit not
necessarily a satisfactory one in some cases — i.e.: manual
mixins. Being able to reproduce semantics that are not provided straight
away on the language by patterns leveraging the built-in constructs is
an important part of the language, and this all is made easier because
of the way functions are treated in JavaScript.

<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> : While an <code>IdentifierName</code> also allows reserved words, you should
